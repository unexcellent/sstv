//! Scottie modes.

//! Scottie modes transmit green, blue and red scans of every line. They are
//! unusual in two ways: the sync pulse sits between the blue and the red scan
//! instead of at the line break, and a single extra sync pulse precedes the
//! very first line (emitted here as the last header tone).
