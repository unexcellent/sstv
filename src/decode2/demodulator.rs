/// Estimates the instantaneous frequency of a stream of PCM samples.

/// `Demodulator` is the inverse of [`Synthesizer`](crate::Synthesizer): it turns
/// 16-bit samples back into a stream of [`Frequency`] estimates. It performs no
/// protocol interpretation — grouping the frequency track into pixels and
/// scanlines is the decoder's job.
///
/// This is a deliberately simple *midline-crossing* estimator. It measures the
/// number of samples between every *other* crossing of the waveform's midline —
/// a full period — and holds that estimate until the next crossing is seen.
/// Measuring a full period rather than a single half-period cancels the
/// alternating long/short bias that appears when the midline is not perfectly
/// centred, which would otherwise make the estimate swing above and below the
/// true frequency every half cycle. The midline is the
/// midpoint of a running minimum and maximum that continuously relax toward it,
/// forming an adaptive envelope: the midline tracks a changing DC offset or
/// signal level, and an early transient (a click, a burst of static) cannot
/// latch it away from the signal — which would otherwise stop the crossings the
/// estimator depends on. The crossing position is linearly interpolated between
/// the two straddling samples for sub-sample accuracy. The approach is cheap and
/// allocation-free, but only moderately noise resistant and less accurate when
/// there are few samples per cycle.
///
/// The iterator yields *nothing* during an initial warm-up rather than a
/// placeholder value: it needs a pair of crossings to measure a period, and it
/// drops the first few crossings while the envelope grows to span a full cycle
/// and its midline is still biased. Once the first estimate is available it
/// yields one estimate per input sample. The dropped warm-up is bounded to a
/// few periods and, for SSTV, always falls inside the leader tone.
